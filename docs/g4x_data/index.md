# <span class="index-header">:material-map-legend: G4X data</span>

The G4X produces multi-modal output containing tables, images, arrays and annotated matrices for single-cell analysis.
The files found in the output directory are compatible with popular Python libraries from the [`scverse`](https://github.com/scverse) ecosystem, like `scanpy, rapids-singlecell, squidpy, and spatial-data` and, if you prefer working in R, can be easily imported into [`Seurat`](https://satijalab.org/seurat/).

### In this section you will find:

+ details on the [G4X output](./g4x_output.md) files and their organization
+ guides on [importing](./data_import.md) G4X data into popular analysis tools in Python and R
