# :material-magnify: G4X Viewer
### An interactive data exploration tool designed for G4X Data.  

G4X Viewer is an advanced, open source project designed to visualize imaging data using modern web technologies. The project is continuously evolving to provide an intuitive and flexible interface for the analysis and presentation of complex datasets. Inspired by the [Viv](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/viv) library, our goal is to push the boundaries of interactive data visualization in web applications.

The G4X Viewer enables you to visualize and interact with your [G4X data](../g4x_data/g4x_output.md) in a user-friendly interface. With it, you can begin to understand spatial patterning of your tissues, take screenshots of specific features of interest, subsample your data, and gain insights into your specific biological system.

We provide a web-based version of the G4X Viewer that can be accessed through our [website](https://g4x-viewer.singulargenomics.com). For users who want to use it locally, we also provide installation instructions on our [Github](https://github.com/Singular-Genomics/G4X-viewer).
