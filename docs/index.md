<br>


#### Welcome to G4X Documentation.  

These pages provide documentation, example workflows, and helper tools for analyzing, and post-processing data generated by the [**G4X spatial sequencer**](https://www.singulargenomics.com/g4x).

<br>

## :material-file: G4X Data
---
#### Output reference and analysis import guides.  

The G4X produces multi-modal output containing tables, images, arrays and annotated matrices for single-cell analysis.
The files found in the output directory are compatible with popular Python libraries from the [`scverse`](https://github.com/scverse) ecosystem, like `scanpy, rapids-singlecell, squidpy, and spatial-data` and, if you prefer working in R, can be easily imported into [`Seurat`](https://satijalab.org/seurat/).

#### In this section you will find:

+ details on the [G4X output](./g4x_data/g4x_output.md) files and their organization
+ guides on [importing](./g4x_data/data_import.md) G4X data into popular analysis tools in Python and R 

<br>

## :material-magnify: G4X Viewer

The G4X Viewer is a Python-based, multi-purpose, interactive viewer specifically designed to help you explore your G4X data. The G4X Viewer is accessible through our [website](https://g4x-viewer.singulargenomics.com) or can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/Singular-Genomics/G4X-viewer) as a standalone application and hosted locally.

#### In this section you can:

+ find [resources](./g4x_viewer/resources.md) to learn how to navigate your data with the G4X Viewer

## :material-code-brackets: G4X-helpers

#### Helper models and post-processing tools for G4X data.  

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/singular-genomics/g4x-helpers
```

With [G4X-helpers](https://github.com/Singular-Genomics/G4X-helpers) we provide an open-source toolkit for common post-processing tasks â€” such as applying custom segmentations or adding your own labels to the G4X-viewer. You can access its core features from the command-line interface (CLI) and additionally import it as a standalone Python package to interact with your data.

#### In this section you can:

+ learn how to [install](./g4x_helpers/installation/index.md) G4X-helpers on your system
+ get started with [using](./g4x_helpers/usage.md) the command line interface (CLI)
+ find a description of [CLI features](./g4x_helpers/features/index.md)

## :material-code-tags: G4X Tutorials
---

G4X Tutorials are a collection of example workflows that demonstrate how to analyze G4X data using popular Python and R libraries. These tutorials cover a wide range of topics, from basic data import and visualization to advanced analysis techniques.

#### In this section you can:

+ learn how to [plot spatial](./g4x_tutorials/plot_spatial.md) tissue information from the G4X data
+ generate novel nuclear or cytoplasmic [segmentations](./g4x_tutorials/segment_data.md) with popular models
