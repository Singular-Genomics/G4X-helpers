### Welcome to G4X-tutorials.  

These pages guide you through working with data generated by the **G4X spatial sequencer**.

For common downstream tasks‚Äîsuch as applying custom segmentations or adding your own labels to the G4X-viewer‚Äîwe provide an open-source toolkit, [`g4x-helpers`](https://github.com/Singular-Genomics/G4X-helpers). You can use its core features from the command-line interface (CLI) and additionally imoprt it as a standalone Python module to interact with the data.

The files found in the output directory are compatible with popular Python libraries from the scverse ecosystem, like `scanpy, rapids-singlecell, squidpy, and spatial-data` and, if you prefer working in R, can be easily imported into `Seurat`.

For details on how to load G4X data into these tools, refer to the [data import section](./g4x_data/data_import.md).
