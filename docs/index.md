With [G4X-helpers](https://github.com/Singular-Genomics/G4X-helpers) we provide an open-source toolkit for common downstream tasks — such as applying custom segmentations or adding your own labels to the G4X-viewer. You can access its core features from the command-line interface (CLI) and additionally import it as a standalone Python package to interact with your data.


```bash
$ pip install g4x_helpers
