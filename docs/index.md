#### Helper models and post-processing tools for G4X data.  

`$ git clone https://github.com/singular-genomics/g4x-helpers`

With [`g4x-helpers`](https://github.com/Singular-Genomics/G4X-helpers) we provide an open-source toolkit for common post-processing tasks â€” such as applying custom segmentations or adding your own labels to the G4X-viewer. You can access its core features from the command-line interface (CLI) and additionally import it as a standalone Python package to interact with your data.

#### In this section you can:

+ learn how to [install](./g4x_helpers/installation.md) G4X-helpers on your system
+ get started with [using](./g4x_helpers/usage.md) the command line interface (CLI)
+ find a description of [CLI features](./g4x_helpers/usage.md)

## :material-map-legend: G4X data
#### Reference and analysis import guides.  

The G4X produces multi-modal output containing tables, images, arrays and annotated matrices for single-cell analysis.
The files found in the output directory are compatible with popular Python libraries from the [`scverse`](https://github.com/scverse) ecosystem, like `scanpy, rapids-singlecell, squidpy, and spatial-data` and, if you prefer working in R, can be easily imported into [`Seurat`](https://satijalab.org/seurat/).

#### In this section you will find:

+ details on the [G4X output](./g4x_data/g4x_output.md) files and their organization
+ guides on [importing](./g4x_data/data_import.md) G4X data into popular analysis tools in Python and R
